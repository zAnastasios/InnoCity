# InnoCity

## Usage

This project was developed as a MVP for the JA Startup 2019 univercity contest. It is a android application that users log in selecting the
municipality of their choice and they can make forms about public problems that they face (broken lights, damaged signs etc.)
. The user can also get informed about any news, events from their municipality directly and they can also get answers about FAQ.
Finally , with the help from loca	volunteering groups they can arrange actions that help the city.

## Contributing
This is an unfinished project with alot of additional work needed, as it was an MVP. Pull requests are welcome.
